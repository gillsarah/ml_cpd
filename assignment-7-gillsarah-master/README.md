# Data_Skills_F2019_assignment_7

__Due date: Tuesday December 10th before midnight__

In class this week we discussed the basics of machine learning, and went over the sklearn framework in Python.  In the past few weeks we have used two datasets - the Chicago Police data and the education data from the Urban institute.  Your task for your final homework assignment is to combine these things.

1. Choose either the Chicago Police data from the Invisible Institute (assignments 4 and 5), or the education data from the Urban Institute (assignment 6).
2. Explore the data with summary statistics and visualiations.  You can reuse functions from the relevant earlier assignments for all loading and analysis.
3. Perform any necessary preprocessing (to be discussed on Thursday).
4. Use a test harness to assess which model to use (more discussion of this to follow on Thursday).
5. Fit a supervised ML model (regression or classification) to the data in that way that lets you make useful predictions.

End your code with a few lines discussing what you found.  Did your model do a good job of predicting labels?  What did you anticipate from step 2 and 4 above?  What accuracy measure did you use to evaluate the model results, and why?

As always, don't forget your functions and other good coding practices!
